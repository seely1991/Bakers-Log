# Bakers-Log
Make a baking list of ingredients with built in unit converters

My first attempt at using jquery
The idea was something I have always wanted to be able to have (stemming from the suggestion of making a to-do list)
When baking, I like to use weighted ingredients, but always have to do calculations to convert from volumetric units, and this makes it simple for me to use before I start.

Support for converting volumetric units to units of weight relies on whether or not I have the conversion units for each specific ingredient. As such, I need to continue to add conversion data for more units. This might be a good place to use an api (or create my own).
